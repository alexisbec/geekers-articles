# Capstone Project for Ruby on Rails

> This is a Website based on the Lifestyle web, where you can create and vote articles, and the most voted article will be displayed on the main page of the web.

# About

> This is an app where you can create an account and then login to create articles and vote for the better ones. The main purpose of this project was to build the correct associations between the categories and the articles to show the correct content on the main page.

What you can do on the app:
- Sign up and Log in
- Create articles and see other articles from all the users
- Users can vote for all the articles

In this project I:
- Used PostgreSQL as the database
- Created advanced associations between users, articles, and categories
- Used scopes to make more efficient database queries
- Created models, views, and controllers for users, articles, and categories
- Used Rspec to test model validations and associations
- Added a unique vote or unvote button for each article with a user
